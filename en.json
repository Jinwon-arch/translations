    "manual": "In the face of the weaponization of weather, of war in the atmosphere, of violence in the air, finding our own ways of occupying an atmosphere become radical acts of resistance, solidarity, and a new and improved understanding of what weather is. “Weather”, therefore, is not limited to the description of a sunny day. Weather is the visible and invisible, weather is everything everywhere, never limited by a particular space or time. It is the continuous entanglement of meteorological, social, political, individual, and communal conditions, each inseparable from the other. These circumstances together are the weather. It is an infrastructure we constantly inhabit.",
    "LightItalic": "“On some days, the weather between us is a polar jet stream, a meandering wind connection London and Vienna with particulates, aeroplankton and water. On other days it is a political climate, illness, or the preoccupations of long-distance friendships.” (Open Weather, The Weather Between Us, 2023-, https://open-weather.community/weather-between-us/) […] “Weathering” in this case, means “learning to live with the changing conditions of rainfall, drought, heat, thaw, and storm as never separable from the ‘total climate’ of the social, political, and cultural existence of bodies.” (Open Weather, https://open-weather.community/feminist-handbook/)"
